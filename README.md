# Vedabrat's Blog/portfolio.

Currently (2/2/2108), This site's purpose was to have a blog that spoke about developer-themed posts.

Honestly, that seems like a 3rd level of just trying to document everything I do.

So instead, you can checkout techit.herokuapp.com/welcome/sisterSites to see what projects have actually been made

recently.

this blog seems to be more for... a random scrawl.
