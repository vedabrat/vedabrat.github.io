<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Let me write out the
story and case of my ticket.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I went to see my
girlfriend and parked on a street corner. There were a couple of lots
nearby that were vacant and there was overgrowth on parts of the
sidewalk and in those lots.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">That fact standing I
found a parking, and took it. Later that night, I come to find that I
was ticketed for parking within 10 feet of a hydrant. Unknowingly, I
had parked next to a hydrant that was shrouded in the overgrowth of
the brush that had hidden the hydrant verily behind it. I wanted to
fight this ticket.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I saw that on my
ticket, there was a court time of 1 pm on october 31<sup>st</sup>. I
went into the facility, prepared to defend my case when I ended up
standing in line with at least 7 other people here for the same
reason. The ticket had reported court time, but that was apparently
only the time that the ticket had to be paid by. The court date wasnt
even issued, but on the back of the ticket, it states “...Please be
advised that you must pleasd Not Guilty at least 7 days prior to the
court date listed on your summons”.<br/>
<br/>
I got mad and
decided I should create a petition site that people can sign and
submit their opinions en masse, and others can sign if they wanted
things changed about forms and documents to avoid the hassle. Because
why should we as people have to bear the burden of the government’s
miscommunication to us?</p>
