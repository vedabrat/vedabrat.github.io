description: Goals as a Frontend Developer
---

As a Frontend Developer, my goals are to be able to strap a company with updates on various things (items, prices, styles, modules, internal programs and services, etc) that they find to be necessary to serve their users or themselves.
I plan on using my abilities as a web developer to give bands useful sites to help them manage themselves, to bond humanitarian communities, and to accumulate wealth.
My school (Bloc) has been an empowering teacher that has armed me with the vast abilities of a web developer. From being able to create Operating systems in browsers to creating complex puzzles and games and outputs, i feel prepared enough to be able to put anything up via a website or protocol.
The biggest challenge I currently have is testing and following a user story. Usually I just stamp whatever I want into the website and make it functional. Following a user story to the way someone else writes it is not the path of least resistance, and as we know, nature prefers that way.
