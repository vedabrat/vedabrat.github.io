Okay, a bit scattered, but some things i want to tackle

1. people need tabla players, harmonium players, and singers for events.

i want to make a venue where they can all come together via an app.
the players get paid whatever rate they put up.
Teams of people who have performed before cost higher. (market rate vs personal rate)

the requesters can put up how much they're willing to spend to get these people together. once everyone fills out their information via a profile and an event setup tab (try to remove redundancy in steps) (questions can be seen in the excel file located here https://vedabrat.github.io/wake_wedding_gettogetherprep.xlsx)

This has been updated on 2018-2-2. Use eventbrite and it's API to register an event and manage that data to come back in.
Add to that view a module that allows users to sign up for events, a user model for the event,
a user model that has an avatar for an event. and any other of the


2. Profiting off of making perishable products less perishable. Drying, Pickling, Canning, Smoking, and Salting and Air-tightening are processes like this.
 Making a good off of a food/vegetable is awesome. you can plan out growth and expected yield for the plants.
Guacamole is an example of this, except it's ability to be consumed fresh is precious, since it oxidizes quickly.
one simple solution is to buy a spray container that sprays lemon/lime onto the Guacamole,

have a contest that gets the best guac made, make it, and ship it out!
